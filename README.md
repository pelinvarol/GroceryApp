# Grocery Shop App
This is a simple grocery shopping app using **Flutter**. The application has three pages, some images, a cart model and an item tile.

## Intro Screen
 This is the first page that appears in this application.  When the user clicks the *Get Started* button, the application redirects the user to the second screen, the home page.

</p>

## Home Page
This page contains a welcome message on the top. Users can add the fresh vegetables and fruits they want to order to their cart by clicking the price button. When the cart button is clicked on the bottom right, the application directs the user to the cart page.

</p>

## Cart Page
On this page, we can view the products we have added to our cart. We can remove the products we want to remove from our cart by clicking the **x**, or we can go back and add more products to our cart by pressing the back button in the upper left. 
At the bottom, the total price of the cart is displayed and there is a payment button next to it. **'Pay Now'** button is not active and it does not direct to user any other page.
  

 - When you delete or add products, the total price value displayed at
   the bottom will be updated.
